# Typescript 2D engine tutorial

This is source code for a realtime 2D engine built with Typescript and SVG. It's is currently a work in progress and is being built as a tutorial on my website [ronandoherty.com](https://www.ronandoherty.com.)

This repo builds on code from my post [Creating a Typescript boilerplate for frontend projects](http://localhost:3000/blog/typescript-boilerplate-for-frontend).
